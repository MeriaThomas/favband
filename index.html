    <p>Since bursting onto Anjunabeats with his debut solo release back in 2012, London-based producer ilan Bluestone’s whirlwind journey through the international dance music scene has been nothing short of monumental. With a string of hit releases such as the Pete Tong-endorsed ‘Big Ben’, ‘Under My Skin’ and ‘Spheres’ under his belt, he now has an impressive array of live performances at venues as prestigious as London’s Brixton Academy and New York’s Madison Square Garden to underline his star status.</p>
    <p>In the last 12 months ilan has continued to dominate the Beatport Trance charts, with dancefloor anthem ‘43’ taking his tally of top spots to 9, and his ‘Snapdragon’ EP reaching #1 in the overall releases chart. ilan’s productions are a staple of Above & Beyond’s DJ sets, and gains frequent support from other international DJ’s including Armin van Buuren, Tiesto and Seven Lions.
